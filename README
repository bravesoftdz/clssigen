Client SSI Generator
====================

Client SSI Generator is a complementary tool for web designers. It mimics the
SSI server (Server Side Includes) behaviour, but on the client side. It may be
used for preprocessing HTML pages in the case there's no SSI service available
on the HTTP server, nor is there any more advanced service like CGI, ASP or PHP.

SSI mechanism is extremely useful for creating a consistent website design. You
define templates, which are automatically inserted into pages by the server at
specified positions. And if such a service is not available (no SSI support or
no server involved in HTML content deliveryâ€”for example, in HTML Help (.chm)
files), the program can to a certain extent solve this by creating SSI content
at the designer's workplace. It is anyway much easier than manually rewrite
hundreds of pages when you just need to alter the main menu of the website.

Requirements
------------

The program needs ca. 2 MB free space on the hard drive and 8 MB of installed
physical memory (more memory recommended for proper file caching).

Operating system: Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP.

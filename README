Client SSI Generator
====================

Client SSI Generator is a complementary tool for web designers. It mimics the
SSI server (Server Side Includes) behaviour, but on the client side. It may be
used for preprocessing HTML pages in the case there's no SSI service available
on the HTTP server, nor is there any more advanced service like CGI, ASP or PHP.
